In this case, you need to use the token bridge to swap your ERC20 FET for native FET.\n\nWarning\n\nYou should not send ERC20 FET to this wallet. If you do, you will lose your tokens. The Fetch wallet can only hold native FET tokens and not ERC20 FET tokens.\n\nSend Tokens\u00b6\n\nTo send tokens from your account:\n\nSelect Send.\n\nFill in the details of your transaction:\n\nRecipient: the address you want to send the tokens to\nToken: the token denomination or type\nAmount: the number of tokens you want to send with this transaction (you can see your current balance above the Amount)\nMemo (Optional): some transactions (e.g. to/from some exchanges) require a specific memo. If not needed, you can leave it blank.\nFee: the transaction fee. Choose from Low, Average and High\n\nTip\n\nUsually, the lower the transaction fee, the longer you need to wait for your transaction to be settled on the network.\n\nPress Send.\n\nIn the summary screen, review the details and if everything is correct, select Approve.\n\nTip\n\nYou can check the status of your transaction via the explorer.\n\n Back to top\nPrevious\nGetting Started\nNext\nWhat is Staking?\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 - 2023 Fetch.ai - Change cookie settings\n      \nCookie consent\n\nWe use cookies to recognize your preferences and measure the effectiveness of our documentation via the feedback widget at the bottom of every docs page.

It is used to pay for fees on the Fetch.ai network and can also be used as a medium of exchange in some applications. FET can be converted between ERC20 and native FET using the Fetch Token Bridge.", "A token bridge is a tool that allows users to swap between two different tokens on two different blockchain networks. For example, a token bridge can help a user convert an ERC20 token from the Ethereum network to a native token on another network, such as Binance Smart Chain. Token bridges are also used to facilitate liquidity transfers between different networks."]}
