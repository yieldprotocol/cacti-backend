It's made up of two parts: build and incubate. It\u2019s a one-stop station for Web3 builders to kickstart their projects and the gateway for Web3 users to contribute meaningfully and \u2018truly\u2019 own high-quality Web3 projects. Alpha Venture DAO is supported by Alpha Network, a group of Web3 thought leaders, and our partners Amazon Web Services and Terraform Labs. Check out our website for more information.", "Web3 builders from anywhere in the world can apply. We offer two programs that cater to different stages: Build and Launch. Build Track is for early stage projects with team, product ideas, and a reasonable protocol architecture / design including protocol components, flow & interactions. Launch Track is for mid to late stage projects that have a workable product and have raised a small funding round, but have yet to launch on mainnet or yet to launch the token. Fill out this application form in less than 30 minutes and you\u2019re all set.", "To ensure that every application is complete and fair for everyone, we have a thorough due diligence process. After the application is submitted, each project is reviewed by our Token Engineering team, who have several decades of experience building the best tools in the ecosystem. This process includes a thorough review of the project roadmap, past milestones, and budget, and a comprehensive assessment of the proposed team. Additionally, we have a technical interview for development projects. Determining who is responsible for approval is also a vital part of this process, and can be done either manually through a database tool such as Airtable or Typeform, or through an on-chain alternative such as Gitcoin's Grants Hub."]}
