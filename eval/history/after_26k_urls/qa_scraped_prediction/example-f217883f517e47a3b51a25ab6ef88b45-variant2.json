It allows for proposals to be discussed and voted on by the community, and provides a way for the Protocol to stay up to date with the changing needs of the users.", "The Aladdin Improvement Proposal Framework is a tool that provides a clear and transparent process for Aladdin governance to adapt and evolve the Protocol as needed. It is implemented by creating proposals that are discussed on the governance forum and voted on using Snapshot. The proposals are split into three categories: APIR, APGP, and APIP. Each category has a different voting duration and quorum, and requires a post on the governance forum at least 48 hours before posting on Snapshot.", "The Signal Request process is a way for the Aladdin community to express their opinion on proposed changes to the Aladdin Protocol. It is a way for the community to provide feedback and help shape the future of the protocol. The Signal Request process is an important part of the Aladdin Improvement Proposal Framework, as it allows the community to have a say in the decisions that are made."]}
