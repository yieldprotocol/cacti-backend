The Fetch wallet can only hold native FET tokens and not ERC20 FET tokens.\n\nSend Tokens\u00b6\n\nTo send tokens from your account:\n\nSelect Send.\n\nFill in the details of your transaction:\n\nRecipient: the address you want to send the tokens to\nToken: the token denomination or type\nAmount: the number of tokens you want to send with this transaction (you can see your current balance above the Amount)\nMemo (Optional): some transactions (e.g. to/from some exchanges) require a specific memo. If not needed, you can leave it blank.\nFee: the transaction fee. Choose from Low, Average and High\n\nTip\n\nUsually, the lower the transaction fee, the longer you need to wait for your transaction to be settled on the network.\n\nPress Send.\n\nIn the summary screen, review the details and if everything is correct, select Approve.\n\nTip\n\nYou can check the status of your transaction via the explorer.\n\n Back to top\nPrevious\nGetting Started\nNext\nWhat is Staking?\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 - 2023 Fetch.ai - Change cookie settings\n      \nCookie consent\n\nWe use cookies to recognize your preferences and measure the effectiveness of our documentation via the feedback widget at the bottom of every docs page.

It works by creating a bridge between two blockchains, allowing users to move tokens from one chain to the other. This is useful for users who want to use tokens from different blockchains in the same application. For example, if you wanted to use tokens from Ethereum and Binance Chain in the same application, you could use a token bridge to move tokens between the two chains."]}, "personality_responses": ["yes", "yes", "yes"]}
