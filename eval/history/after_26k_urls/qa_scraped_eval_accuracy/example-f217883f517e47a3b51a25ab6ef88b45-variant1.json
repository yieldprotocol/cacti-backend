It enables Aladdin members to put forth, vote on, and implement proposals that determine the future of the Protocol. The framework ensures that all decisions are made in the best interests of users, creating a system that is secure, robust, and responsive to changing conditions.", "The Aladdin Governance Framework is built on rigorously vetted, reproducible, scientific models created by experts with proven track records in the traditional finance space. This framework is used to inform the governance and risk decisions related to the Protocol. It helps create policy, procedures, and controls to minimize risks, ensure sufficient capital reserves, and ensure the Protocol is managed in a secure and responsible way. Governance and Risk Meetings are conducted to discuss the progress of the framework, solicit feedback from the community, and ultimately make decisions to amend the framework and adjust the Protocol.", "The Signal Request process is an important part of the AIP Framework. It is a way for members of the Aladdin community to submit their own proposals and potentially have them implemented on the Aladdin Protocol. Signal Requests allow a proposal to gain support from the community before being put forward in the AIP Framework. The Signal Request process also helps build consensus and gain support for proposed amendments to the Protocol."]}, "accuracy_responses": ["yes", "yes", "yes"]}
