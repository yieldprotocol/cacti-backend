LDO voting weight is proportional to the amount of LDO a voter stakes in the voting contract. The more LDO in a user\u2019s voting contract, the greater the decision-making power the voter gets. The exact mechanism of LDO voting can be upgraded just like the other DAO applications.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd If you have any initiatives you think will benefit the Lido protocol, share your thoughts in our governance forum.\n\nSoftware\u200b\n\nThe Lido DAO is an Aragon organization.
