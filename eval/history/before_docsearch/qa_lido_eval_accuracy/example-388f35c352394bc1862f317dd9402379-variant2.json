Also, the DAO will accumulate service fees and spend them on research, development, liquidity mining incentives and protocol upgrades. \n\nWhy DAO?\u200b\n\nThe DAO is the logical compromise between full centralization and decentralisation, which allows the deployment of competitive products without full centralization and custody on the exchanges. We do not believe that it is possible to make a liquid staking protocol that is completely trustless.
