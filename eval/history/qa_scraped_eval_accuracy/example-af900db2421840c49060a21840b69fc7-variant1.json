The token was deployed on Ethereum as non-upgradable ERC-20 with fixed supply, and then bridged to NEAR and AURORA using the trustless Rainbow Bridge. Here are respective links to the token on NEAR and Aurora protocols.\n\nThere were 1,000,000,000 Aurora tokens (AURORA) created at Genesis on October 7, 2021.\n\nThe current allocation consists of:\n\n20% (200 million) \u2013 Community Treasury\n16% (160 million) \u2013 Aurora Labs long term incentives. Tokens are subjected to a vesting scheme determined by Aurora Labs.\n9% (90 million) \u2013 Aurora Labs private round investors. These tokens are subjected to the unlocking scheme.\n3% (30 million) \u2013 Allocated to Aurora validator delegators.\n2% (20 million) \u2013 Early AURORA contributors. Allocations should be provided by NEAR Foundation. These tokens should be subjected to the unlocking scheme. NEAR Foundation may implement a vesting scheme for these tokens.\n1% (10 million) \u2013 Allocated to Aurora Labs to be used as incentives for project advisors\n1% (10 million) \u2013 Allocated for bootstrapping the AURORA ecosystem.\n3% (30 million) \u2013 Allocated for Aurora Labs growth round\n2.6% (26 million) \u2013 Allocated for ongoing grant programs\n1.8 % (18 million) \u2013 Allocated for ongoing projects\n40.6% (406 million) \u2013 Kept on the DAO balance for future projects\n\nAs the Protocol grows and new initiatives are approved, the allocation changes: new categories might be added or aggregated. No changes in the currently distributed tokens can be made.\n\nPlanning circulating supply\n\n\u201cCirculating Supply\u201d is every token that isn\u2019t subject to a lockup at a particular time. The vast majority of the AURORA supply is subject to long-term lockups. All supply is planned to be unlocked by month 132 from Token Generation Event on November 18, 2021 (TGE).\n\nThe chart below shows the increase in circulating supply as tokens unlock:\n\nComponents of circulating supply\n\nThe following chart provides more detail on the components of the circulating supply as it grows over time.\n\nThe following chart provides a closer look to the components of circulating supply within only 36 months following TGE.\n\nUnlock Schedules\nPrivate round investors\n\n9% of all tokens was allocated to Aurora Labs private round investors. According to the most recent DAO decision from April 2022 with the following schedule: 2 unlocks of 3.25M AURORA in May and August 2022, 3.5M AURORA in November 2022 and 8 consequent unlocks of 10M AURORA on every third month starting from February 2023. All the tokens will be unlocked at the end of the month 36.\n\nAurora Labs long term incentives\n\nThe focus of Aurora Labs is to develop AURORA tech, which includes Aurora Engine and Rainbow Bridge. Besides that, there are four new products that are in development at the moment, and more may be added to the roadmap.\n\nTeam's allocation provides reasonable incentivisation and governance participation when the governance tools are implemented.\n\nThe unlocking scheme for this stream is a modified version of standard 4 year linear unlock; 1 year cliff scheme. Instead of unlocking 25% (40M AURORA) of the tokens after 12 month, only 10% (16M AURORA) are unlocked, while the remaining 15% (24M AURORA) are distributed linearly over the months 13 - 24 (in addition to other 40M AURORA provided by the initial scheme). The distribution of remaining 50% (80M AURORA) is linear over months 25 - 48.\n\nSuch updated distribution allows to smoothen the cliff and ensure the steady unlock of the tokens.\n\nNot all of the AURORA tokens have been allocated to the team already: there is an unallocated supply kept for the future growth of the team. From this supply the vesting agreements for the newcomers are funded.\n\nOther expected token unlocks\nCommunity treasury\n\n200 million AURORA tokens are devoted to the community treasury. AURORA token holders should be able to decide on the distribution of these tokens to the initiatives and projects that are planning to launch on Aurora.\n\nAurora Labs growth round\n\nAurora DAO has voted on the allocation of 3% of AURORA tokens (30M) to Aurora Labs on 18th of April 2022 in this proposal, to conclude a growth round. Because of unfavorable market conditions, Aurora Labs decided to delay the round.\n\nDAO projects (grant programs, ongoing and future projects)\n\nCurrent initiatives of the Aurora DAO consist of grant programs (Proximity partnership and Fast grants program), ongoing projects (bug bounty program, and bootstrapping Aurora+ through AURORA stream, ecosystem streams and airdrop) and future projects.\n\nAs of June 2022, grant programs and ongoing projects are fully determined buckets that have fixed distribution. Future projects bucket is unclear and below the assumed distribution provided. The plan is that this component will be gradually used to fund specific DAO projects until its full allocation within 11 years after TGE to ensure continuous growth of the Aurora ecosystem.\n\nMethodological Notes\nTime buckets should be read as \u201cend of month\u201d unless otherwise noted, meaning the bucket for \u201cmonth 12\u201d includes the initial balance on the first day of that month plus any change within that month. \u201cMonth 0\u201d is the only bucket which is typically used to represent genesis without any additional time.\nDistribution streams are different. Some of them (for example, private round investors) are accurate and others (future DAO projects) contain projected values.\nAmounts are intended to be accurate but may still contain imprecisions and are subject to change.\nThis document is intended to be updated over time to reflect changes in the distribution streams and keep the community up to date about the current AURORA distribution.\nChanges applied to the initial distribution as of June 2022\nAurora IDO was approved by the DAO on 2nd of November 2021. Details of the IDO can be found here.\nBecause of the development of the new staking farm validator, parameters of the Aurora validator have been refined in this post and voted by the DAO on 21st of January, 2022 (multiple proposals) and updated to allow for the rounding bug with this proposal.\nThe unlocking schedule for the private round investors was delayed on 26th of April 2022. Details on the new unlocking scheme can be found here.\nThe unlocking schedule for the Aurora Labs team members was delayed on 24 of June 2022 to support the smoother unlocks of AURORA in the market.\nChange Log\n\n24 June 2022 - initial version\n\nMore details about AURORA token distribution can be found in this blog post.\n\nJump right in\n\nWhether you\u2019re an individual looking to use one of the projects or a developer wanting to build on Aurora, now is the time to get started.\n\nDiscover Aurora+\nEnjoy free transactions and unique ecosystem rewards.\nGet started\nRainbow Bridge\nTransfer tokens between Ethereum, NEAR & Aurora\nTransfer tokens\nAurora Ecosystem\nBrowse dapps that have already launched on Aurora.\nBrowse dapps\nJoin Discord\nChat with the Aurora team and get support.\nJoin Discord\nAbout\nAbout Aurora\nNews & Updates\nPress Kit\nVideos\nEcosystem\nEcosystem Apps\nTokens\nPartner Program\nAurora DAO\nAURORA Token\nAURORA Futures Token\nFaucet\nRainbow Bridge\nDevelopers\nDocumentation\nBlock Explorer\nFaucet\nTestnet Bridge\nAudits\nBug Bounty Program\nDiscord\nGitHub\nSupport\nGet Help\nKnowledge Base\nContact\nTelegram\nDiscord\nDiscord\nForum\nTelegram\nTwitter\nYouTube\nGitHub\nInstagram\nMedium\nFacebook\n\u00a9 2023 AuroraPrivacy PolicyTerms of Use\nThis site uses cookies.\nRead more\nOK", "interactions": [{"input": "What is the Aurora DAO?", "response": "The Aurora DAO is a governance organization for the Aurora protocol that oversees projects and initiatives, determines which applications and improvements to support, and allocates token rewards.
