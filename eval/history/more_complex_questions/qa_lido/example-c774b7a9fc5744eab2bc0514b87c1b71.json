{"scraped_filename": "https:__docs.lido.fi_.txt", "context": "Through the use of a liquid staking solution such as Lido, users can eliminate these inconveniences and benefit from secure, non-custodial staking backed by industry leaders. Liquid staking is unlocking the potential of PoS by giving users the ability to not only stake their assets, but have the liquidity to use those assets in DeFi projects that way not only increasing yields for the individual, but growing the staking participation in general.\n\nLido on Ethereum APR\u200b\n\nnote\n\n APR provides only the current estimation of the rewards without any upfront forecasts.\n\nUser's APR (Lido staking APR) = Protocol APR * (1 - Protocol fee)\n\nProtocol APR\u200b\n\nBy Protocol APR we mean gross annual percentage rate \u2014 the overall Consensus Layer (CL) and Execution Layer (EL) rewards received by Lido validators to total pooled ETH estimated as moving average of the last 7 days.\n\nMore about Protocol APR calculation\n\nConsensus Layer\u200b\n\nValidators receive rewards when they perform consensus layer validators\u2019 duties:\n\nThe value of the rewards in each epoch is calculated from a base reward. This is the base unit representing the average reward received by a validator under optimal conditions per epoch. Base rewards are inversely proportional to the square root of the total staked ether in Ethereum, that's why the amount of reward per validator decreases as the overall number of validators on Ethereum grows.\n\nIn addition to rewards, penalties and slashing can be applied to validators on the CL.\n\nA penalty is a form of reducing the validator\u2019s stake, which is not online or doesn\u2019t meet certain specifications criteria when attesting the blocks.\n\nBeing slashed means that the misbehaving validator is forced to exit the beacon chain at a point in the future, receiving a number of penalties until it leaves. As a result of it, APR can also reduce.\n\nPerformance of Lido validators\n\nThe better the underlying operator sets are, the more robust, resilient, and performant the underlying protocol. Check Operator Statistics and Metrics.\n\nLearn more about rewards and penalties - ethereum.org\n\nExecution Layer\u200b\n\nValidators began to receive EL rewards after the Merge. EL rewards consist of four parts:\n\nPriority fee\n\nPriority fee refers to optional additional fees (for example it may refer to EIP-1559) paid directly to validators in order to incentivize them to include the given transaction in a block. Also it depends on network demand: as higher network demand, as higher could be priority fee.\n\nMaximal Extractable Value (MEV) rewards\n\nMEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted by the validator from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block.\n\nCompounding\n\nThe collected EL rewards (Priority fee + MEV) are available directly on the Execution layer, and thus, can be re-staked with Lido on the daily basis. Earning further staking rewards on the re-staked EL rewards creates the compounding effect.\n\nRewards socialization model\n\nWith Lido, you receive staking rewards within 24 hours of your deposit being made, without waiting for validator activation.\n\nProtocol fee\u200b\n\nLido applies a 10% fee on staking rewards that are split between node operators and the DAO Treasury. The fee can be changed by the DAO pending a successful vote.\n\nSecurity\u200b\n\nThe security of Lido is highest priority beginning at the time of its initial deployment, but still users should investigate risks involved with Lido before engaging with it. We are constantly working on security improvements:\n\nIn the scorecard you may find an  outlined set of attributes that we think are important for the decentralisation of the protocol, and how Lido is faring against these targets.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd As for now, scorecard has only Ethereum related content.
