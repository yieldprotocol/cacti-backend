It is designed to ensure that all stakeholders have a say in the decision-making process, and that all proposals are rigorously vetted and evaluated before being implemented. The framework consists of three stages: Proposal, Discussion, and Voting. In the Proposal stage, users submit their proposals to the Aladdin Protocol. In the Discussion stage, users can discuss the merits of the proposal and provide feedback. Finally, in the Voting stage, users can cast their votes on the proposal.", "The Signal Request process is a tool used in the Aladdin Improvement Proposal Framework to allow stakeholders to signal their opinion on proposed changes to the Aladdin Protocol. This process allows stakeholders to express their opinion on proposed changes before they are implemented, and allows the Aladdin Protocol to adapt and evolve as needed."]}, "personality_responses": ["yes", "yes", "yes"]}
