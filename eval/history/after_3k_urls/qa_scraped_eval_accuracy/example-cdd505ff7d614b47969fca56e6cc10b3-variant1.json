It is backed by BANANO, and is used to access a variety of DeFi services such as farming, lending, and borrowing."}]}, "responses": ["wBAN is short for Wrapped Banano. The main idea is that you wrap your Banano as wBAN tokens, and unwrap wBAN tokens back to Banano crypto. This allows you to use a representation of Banano on other networks! wBAN is currently available on the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Fantom. See wBAN FAQ for more details. wBAN was created to connect Banano to the wider smart-contracts / DeFi ecosystem. We love seeing monkeys learning and participating in DeFi!"]}, "accuracy_responses": ["yes"]}
