By staking with Lido your assets remain liquid and can be used across a range of DeFi applications, earning extra yield.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd To dive into the details of governance design and implementation, proceed to DAO\n\nEthereum is and remains a primary focus of Lido. That\u2019s affected the organisational structure - the governance is implemented through ERC20 LDO token. Currently Lido supports several PoS networks - when staking native assets with Lido, users will receive a st[token], which represents their [token] which represents their deposit and the rewards aggregated over time (penalties too). The following networks are supported:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Protocols on different networks inherit the architecture of their respective networks. This means that the designs of Lido tokens can vary significantly. Also different protocols are maintained by different dev teams. If you are interested in launching Lido on another network please submit your proposal on the research forum.\n\nSolana\n\nstSOL\n\nPolygon\n\nstMATIC\n\nPolkadot\n\nstDOT\n\nKusama\n\nstKSM\n\nTerra\n\nbLuna and stLuna\n\nLiquid staking\u200b\n\nProblem statement\u200b\n\nTraditionally, staking in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol based projects has been about locking one\u2019s assets in one project for a long time and expecting a fixed, predetermined staking reward in return. While it guarantees the return on staked assets much like a bond, it also limits the opportunities of generating higher returns on those assets from the DeFi ecosystem. If you\u2019ve staked all of your crypto holdings, you can\u2019t invest or trade in more profitable crypto pairs on exchanges.\n\nSolution\u200b\n\nLiquid staking allows using the st[token] in other trading or investing opportunities to let the user get the best of both worlds - a reward on your staked assets, as well as the returns from new trading/investing opportunities. Liquid staking introduces various fundamental benefits by:\n\nComparison with other staking options\u200b\n\nSolo staking is great, but it comes with some disadvantages. Setting up a validator node requires a pristine technical understanding, brings with it a minimum deposit of 32 ETH in Ethereum case, slashing and offline penalties can get very severe if the staking is managed improperly and finally the staked amount is locked up for a significant period.\n\nSolo staking is similar to other option SaaS staking in that you are having your own validator keys. Nevertheless, with SaaS you must trust a third-party (usually centralised), which may act maliciously, attacked or simply regulated. Going back to the Ethereum example, there remains a requirement for a minimum amount of 32 ETH staked.\n\nAlternatively, it may be possible to produce staking through centralised exchanges. Needless to say, crypto assets and CeFi are not suited well together from the fundamental standpoint. It is also worth mentioning the economic aspect - by staking within some centralised entities, the user does not receive a corresponding token in return and, thus, loses the opportunity to perform any subsequent activity within DeFi or the same centralised entity, where assets were staked. Yes, APR, when staking on centralised exchanges might be higher, but with a significant amount aggregated within the centralised entity comes a huge potential influence to the ecosystem that was fundamentally designed decentralised.", "interactions": [{"input": "What is Lido?", "response": "Lido is a liquid staking solution providing a simple and secure way to earn interest on digital assets.

With liquid staking, users can earn rewards on their staked assets while also taking advantage of new trading or investing opportunities. Additionally, liquid staking requires less upfront capital than other staking options, such as solo staking, and does not require a user to lock up their funds for lengthy periods. Liquid staking also eliminates the need to trust a third-party for staking, reducing the risk of malicious activity.", "Compared to solo staking, liquid staking requires less technical expertise to setup and a much lower upfront capital requirement. Additionally, staking with liquid staking is much less risky as it eliminates slashing and hostage risks that are associated with solo staking. Finally, liquid staking does not lock up users\u2019 funds for an extended period of time, allowing for higher liquidity and more opportunity for new investments or trades. By contrast, in SaaS staking there is still a risk that the third-party you are trusting may be acting maliciously, attacked or simply regulated."]}
