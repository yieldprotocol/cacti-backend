In this case, you need to use the token bridge to swap your ERC20 FET for native FET.\n\nWarning\n\nYou should not send ERC20 FET to this wallet. If you do, you will lose your tokens. The Fetch wallet can only hold native FET tokens and not ERC20 FET tokens.\n\nSend Tokens\u00b6\n\nTo send tokens from your account:\n\nSelect Send.\n\nFill in the details of your transaction:\n\nRecipient: the address you want to send the tokens to\nToken: the token denomination or type\nAmount: the number of tokens you want to send with this transaction (you can see your current balance above the Amount)\nMemo (Optional): some transactions (e.g. to/from some exchanges) require a specific memo. If not needed, you can leave it blank.\nFee: the transaction fee. Choose from Low, Average and High\n\nTip\n\nUsually, the lower the transaction fee, the longer you need to wait for your transaction to be settled on the network.\n\nPress Send.\n\nIn the summary screen, review the details and if everything is correct, select Approve.\n\nTip\n\nYou can check the status of your transaction via the explorer.\n\n Back to top\nPrevious\nGetting Started\nNext\nWhat is Staking?\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 - 2023 Fetch.ai - Change cookie settings\n      \nCookie consent\n\nWe use cookies to recognize your preferences and measure the effectiveness of our documentation via the feedback widget at the bottom of every docs page.

It is a long string of alphanumeric characters that starts with the letter \u201c0x\u201d. It is similar to a bank account number, but instead of being associated with a bank, it is associated with the Ethereum blockchain. You can think of it as your Ethereum wallet address.", "ERC20 FET is a type of token that runs on the Ethereum network. It is a fungible token, meaning it is interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. It is used to pay for services in the Fetch.ai ecosystem and network transaction fees. You can purchase ERC20 FET from different centralized or decentralized exchanges.", "A token bridge is a technology that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains. It works by creating a \u201cbridge\u201d between two blockchains, allowing users to transfer tokens from one chain to another. This is done by creating a \u201clock-and-mint\u201d model, where tokens are locked on one chain and minted on the other. This allows users to move tokens between different blockchains without having to go through a centralized exchange. Celer cBridge is a token bridge that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens."]}
