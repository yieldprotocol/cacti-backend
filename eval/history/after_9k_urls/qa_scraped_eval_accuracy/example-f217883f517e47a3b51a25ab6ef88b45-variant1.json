This process allows for community input on proposed updates, and the results of the vote dictate whether or not the proposed changes are implemented."}]}, "responses": ["The Aladdin Improvement Proposal Framework is a tool to provide a clear, transparent process that allows Aladdin governance to adapt and evolve the Protocol as needs and circumstances dictate far into the future. It is split into three categories: Aladdin Improvement Proposals (AIPs), Governance proposals (APGP) and Improvement Protocol (APIP). The voting duration and quorum requirements vary according to the category of proposal.", "The Aladdin Governance framework is implemented through the Aladdin Protocol, an open source, community-governed, permissionless protocol that provides a platform for decentralized finance applications. The protocol is powered by Aladdin (Ald) tokens and governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). A Hyperledger project, Aladdin enables everyone to participate in governance at all levels, from basic consensus building to making decisions about protocol updates. Every Ald token holder holds a stake in the Protocol and participates in shaping the future of the Aladdin Protocol.", "The Signal Request process is designed to provide a platform for the Aladdin community to communicate their feedback on proposed Protocol changes. It is an important part of the Aladdin Governance Framework, and provides a way for the community to express their opinion on potential changes and provide input on the decision-making process. Community members can submit a Signal Request on the Aladdin Forum and discuss the proposed changes with others in the community. After the community has had a chance to discuss and provide input, a vote is taken to determine the outcome."]}, "accuracy_responses": ["yes", "yes", "yes"]}
