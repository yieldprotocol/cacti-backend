Borrowers have to pass a stringent KYC/AML process to verify their legitimacy before they can open a pool. You can learn more about each borrower by navigating to their pool  page on the Clearpool app.\nWhat other assets are available, other than USDC?\nInitially all pools will be denominated in USDC. Additional assets may be considered based on demand, and can be added via governance in the future.\nWhat is the risk assessment process?\nThe credit risk score displayed on the Clearpool app is calculated by Credora, the specifics of the calculation can be found here.\nWhat are the anticipated rates of interest for lenders?\nInterest rates will depend on the supply and demand of liquidity for each pool and the resulting liquidity utilization ratio of the pool's borrower. \nDo I have to provide any KYC documents?\nNo, as a lender there are no requirements. Lending to a borrower pool is permissionless and requires only a web3 connection. \nWhich wallets does Clearpool support?\nClearpool currently supports MetaMask and Wallet Connect.\nWhat happens if a borrower closes a pool while my liquidity is still inside? \nPools can be closed at any time through the borrower making full repayment (borrowed amount + interest). However, lenders can still withdraw liquidity from a closed pool, the pool will still appear in the app when the corresponding lender wallet is connected.\nWhat happens to the insurance amount if the pool is successfully closed?\nFAQ - Previous\nFor Borrowers\nNext\nV1 (Deprecated Pools)\nLast modified 4mo ago", "interactions": [{"input": "What is Clearpool?", "response": "Clearpool is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain.
