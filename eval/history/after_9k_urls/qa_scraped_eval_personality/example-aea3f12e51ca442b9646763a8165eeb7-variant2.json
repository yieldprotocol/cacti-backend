Alongside Finance, Inc. (\u201cAlongside\u201d) is a technology provider for the Alongside Crypto Market index and products that are based on that index. Products that utilize the Alongside Crypto Market index or other indexes that have been developed by Alongside are not available for purchase or sale on this website. Carefully consider the risk factors, purchase objectives, fees, expenses, and other information associated with the Alongside Crypto Market Index before making a purchase decision regarding the Alongside Crypto Market Index token or any other products that utilize indexes that have been developed by Alongside (\u201cProducts\u201d). All Products that are speculative in nature involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty. There is no guarantee that any token will grow in value.\n\nFor the Alongside Crypto Market Index token, which is an ERC-20 token available for purchase and sale through multiple channels, there can be no assurance that the value of the token will reflect the value of the Alongside Crypto Market Index net assets. Tokens of any Products may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the network&s net assets. While institutions may engage in arbitrage mechanisms to keep the price of the token closely linked to the value of the Network\u2019s net assets, the price of the index token may deviate significantly from the performance of the Net Asset Value per token (\u201cNAV\u201d). There is no guarantee that any token will grow in value.\n\nCertain of the Products may be subject to the risks associated with purchasing crypto assets, including cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens. Because crypto-assets are a new technological innovation with a limited history, they are a highly speculative asset. Future regulatory actions or policies may limit the ability to sell, exchange or use a crypto asset. The price of a crypto asset may be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, which may impact their price.\n\nPrior to making any purchase decision in respect of any Product, each prospective user must undertake its own independent examination and investigation of the Product, including the merits and risks involved in a purchase of the Product, and must base its decision, including a determination of whether the Product would be a suitable purchase for the prospective user, on such examination and investigation and must not rely on Alongside Finance, Inc. or the Products in making such decision. Past performance of any Product is not indicative of future results. Prospective users must not construe the contents of this website as legal, tax, investment, or other advice. Each prospective user is urged to consult with its own advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory, financial, accounting and similar consequences of investing in any Product, the suitability of the purchase for such user and other relevant matters concerning a purchase of any Product.\n\nThis website contains an overview summary of the constituents of each Product. This website is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation or recommendation to buy units or shares in any Product or any recommendation of any Product. The summary set forth on this website does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to any definitive documents relating to each Product.
